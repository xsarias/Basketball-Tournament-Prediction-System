This defensive strength, in holding team 1264 below their scoring average, proved to be the deciding factor in a closely contested matchup between two similarly-seeded teams.  The small margin of victory suggests a low-scoring, defensively-dominated game that team 1214 was better equipped to navigate.\n","\n"]}],"source":["row = df.iloc[0]\n","\n","prompt1 = f\"\"\"\n","Simulated NCAA Match – Season {row['Season']} ({row['Gender']})\n","\n","Match Summary:\n","- Winner Team ID: {row['WTeamID']} — Seed {row['SeedA']}\n","- Loser Team ID: {row['LTeamID']} — Seed {row['SeedB']}\n","- Seed Difference: {row['SeedDiff']}\n","\n"," Stats:\n","- Winner Win/Loss: {row['W_WinLoss']}, PPG: {row['W_PPG']}, Allowed: {row['W_PtsAllowed']}, Margin: {row['W_Margin']}\n","- Loser Win/Loss: {row['L_WinLoss']}, PPG: {row['L_PPG']}, Allowed: {row['L_PtsAllowed']}, Margin: {row['L_Margin']}\n","\n"," Analysis task:\n","Write a short paragraph explaining why team {row['WTeamID']} likely won this match.

All four feature differences are negative, suggesting Team 1140 (the loser) was significantly stronger across those metrics.  A negative win/loss ratio difference indicates Team 1140 had a better win-loss record, a negative margin difference shows Team 1140 won by a larger average margin, a negative PPG difference shows Team 1140 scored more points per game, and a negative points allowed difference means Team 1140 conceded fewer points.  These are all strong indicators that Team 1140 should have won.
